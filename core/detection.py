class ResonanceDetector:
    """
    Computes similarity metrics between quantum state frequency signatures using normalized inner products.

    This class performs pattern matching by calculating the overlap between frequency-domain 
    representations of quantum states. Given an input state's frequency signature and a set of 
    reference signatures, it identifies the best match by computing normalized complex inner 
    products and returns confidence scores based on the overlap magnitude.

    The matching process:
    1. Takes frequency signatures (64x64 complex arrays from the frequency transform)
    2. Computes normalized overlap scores between input and each reference
    3. Returns detection results with confidence metrics and best match identification
