Quantum state error mitigation through reference-based projection and phase correction.

This module implements error mitigation strategies that improve the fidelity of noisy 
quantum states by leveraging known reference states and error characterization data.

    Mitigates errors in quantum states using reference projection and phase correction techniques.
    
    This class provides two primary mitigation strategies:
    
    1. Reference-based projection: When a high-fidelity reference state is available,
       projects the noisy state onto the reference while preserving relative phase information.
       
    2. Phase correction: When no reference is available, applies phase normalization
       to align the state with standard conventions.
    
    Special handling is included for known error patterns such as parity-preserving 
    bit-flip errors (e.g., |01⟩↔|10⟩ confusion) when backend error characterization 
    data is provided.
